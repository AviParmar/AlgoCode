# Rock, paper, scissor

Just a simple rock, paper, scissor game written in python.

## Prerequisites

You just need to have python3 installed.

### Mac

The easiest way to get python in your mac is using [brew](https://brew.sh/index_es). If you have not installed brew on your computer run:
```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

To install python 3 run 

```bash
    brew install python
```

### GNU/Linux

I will only show you how to install python on the distros I use.

#### Debian-based

```bash
    sudo apt install python3
```

#### Arch-based

```bash
    sudo pacman -S python
```

### Windows

Get the lattest release [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

## Run

Open a term on this route and run:

```bash
    python3 app.py
```

In some distros the package python stands for python 3 and in other it stands for python 2 so take care with that.
